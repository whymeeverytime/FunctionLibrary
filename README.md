# Function Library

This collection of classes will contain some of my favorite mathematical functions and general methods.

Most methods will be static. Methods are at [<ins>/src/functionlibrary</ins>](https://github.com/whymeeverytime/FunctionLibrary/tree/master/src/functionlibrary)

>Roman to integer will be added soon. Then, Taylor series expansion
